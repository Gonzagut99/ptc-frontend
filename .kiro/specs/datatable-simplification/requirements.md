# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification aims to simplify the usage of the existing DataTable component by creating higher-level abstractions and reducing boilerplate code. The current implementation requires extensive manual configuration for server-side pagination, filtering, and state management. The goal is to provide a more declarative API while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Glossary

- **DataTable_Component**: The existing TanStack Table-based component that handles data display, pagination, filtering, and sorting
- **Simplified_DataTable**: A new higher-level wrapper component that reduces configuration complexity
- **Hook_Factory**: A utility function that generates custom hooks for specific data types with minimal configuration
- **Auto_Configuration**: Automatic detection and setup of common DataTable patterns based on data structure
- **Declarative_API**: An interface that allows developers to specify what they want rather than how to implement it

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a paginated data table with minimal configuration, so that I can focus on business logic rather than boilerplate setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides data type and API endpoint, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL automatically configure server-side pagination
2. WHEN a developer specifies column definitions, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL automatically handle state management for filtering and sorting
3. WHEN a developer uses the component, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL require no more than 3 props for basic functionality
4. WHERE custom actions are needed, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL accept optional toolbar actions without breaking existing functionality
5. THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL maintain backward compatibility with the existing DataTable_Component

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate data-specific hooks automatically, so that I don't have to write repetitive pagination and filtering logic for each entity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer calls the Hook_Factory with entity configuration, THE Hook_Factory SHALL generate a custom hook with pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities
2. WHEN the generated hook is used, THE Hook_Factory SHALL provide standardized methods for updateFilters, refetch, and state management
3. THE Hook_Factory SHALL support TypeScript generics for type safety across different data entities
4. WHERE API endpoints follow REST conventions, THE Hook_Factory SHALL automatically infer endpoint patterns
5. THE Hook_Factory SHALL handle error states and loading states consistently across all generated hooks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic column configuration based on data structure, so that I can quickly prototype tables without defining every column manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is provided to Auto_Configuration, THE Auto_Configuration SHALL analyze the data structure and generate appropriate column definitions
2. WHEN column types are detected, THE Auto_Configuration SHALL apply appropriate formatters for dates, numbers, and boolean values
3. WHERE relationships exist in the data, THE Auto_Configuration SHALL create expandable or linked columns automatically
4. THE Auto_Configuration SHALL allow manual column overrides while maintaining auto-generated columns for unspecified fields
5. THE Auto_Configuration SHALL respect existing column definitions and only fill gaps in configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified filter configuration, so that I can add faceted filters without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filter options are provided as simple arrays, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL convert them to the required FacetedFilter format
2. WHEN enum values are detected in TypeScript types, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL automatically generate filter options
3. WHERE custom filter logic is needed, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL accept custom filter functions while maintaining simple defaults
4. THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL handle both client-side and server-side filtering with the same API
5. THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL provide sensible defaults for common filter types (text, select, date range)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling and loading states, so that all tables in the application behave uniformly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are in progress, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL display consistent loading skeletons
2. WHEN API errors occur, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL show standardized error messages with retry options
3. WHERE custom error handling is needed, THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL accept custom error renderers
4. THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL handle network timeouts and connection issues gracefully
5. THE Simplified_DataTable SHALL provide loading states for individual operations (filtering, sorting, pagination)
